# Artifical-Intelligence-Prgramming

Introduction to problem-solving methods from artificial intelligence. Production systems. Knowledge-based systems. Machine learning. Topics chosen from fuzzy logic, neural network models, genetic algorithms. Verification, validation, testing.

All of the file contain here are all done using MATLAB. In these file it will contain program
that deal with Artifical Intelligence. The code in here deals with K-Mean, K Nearest Neighbor,
CNN ( Convolutional Neural Network) and MLP (Multilayer Perception).
